# metron v2
Lightweight JavaScript convenience library (written in TypeScript)

This is not a replacement for jQuery or any other high end framework.
It is meant as a lightweight library for instances where a smaller subset of helper functions are needed.

Helper functions can be found in the metron.extenders.ts file. The full library contains elements for a lightweight front end framework.

This repo contains the development branch.
